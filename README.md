Description: This program computes and displays the charges for a patient hospital stay.
user input for patient if they are in-patient(stay overnight) 
or out-patient (in and out of hospital same day, not overnight)

if in-patient, user input for
a. The number of days spent in the hospital
b. The daily rate
c. Charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
d. Hospital medication charges.

if out-patient, user input for
a. Charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
b. Hospital medication charges.

Use a single, separate function to validate that no input is less than zero. If it is, it should
be re-entered before being returned. (while loop)

Once the required data has been input and validated, the program should use two
overloaded functions to calculate the total charges. One of the functions should accept
arguments for the in-patient data, while the other function accepts arguments for out-
patient data. Both functions should return the total charges.
