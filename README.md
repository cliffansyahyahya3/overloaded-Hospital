Hospital Billing System (C++)

This is a simple C++ console program that calculates hospital charges for patients. The program allows the user to choose whether they are an in-patient or an out-patient, 
then asks for the required billing information and displays a medical invoice.

What the Program Does

  - Asks the user if they are an in-patient or out-patient.

  - Collects billing information based on the patient type.

  - Ensures all numeric inputs are valid and not less than zero.

  - Calculates the total hospital charges.

  - Displays a clear summary of the medical invoice.

  - In-Patient Charges Include Number of days stayed in the hospital, Daily rate,
Hospital service charges (lab tests, etc.), Medication charges.

  - Out-Patient Charges Include Hospital service charges, Medication charges.

- Programming Concepts Used
  - Functions and
    function prototypes

  - Input validation using loops

  - Conditional statements (if / else)

  - Basic user input and output

  -Modular code organization

- Why This Project

  - This project was created to practice core C++ programming concepts such as functions, input validation, and control flow.
    It demonstrates how a real-world problem can be solved using structured and readable code.
